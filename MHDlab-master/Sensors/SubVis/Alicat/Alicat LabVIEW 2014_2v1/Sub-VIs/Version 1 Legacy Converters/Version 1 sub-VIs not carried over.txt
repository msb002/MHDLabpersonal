NOTE: The Version 1_Read Measurement Format and Version 1_Read Measurements VI's do not operate with full compatibility when connecting to newer devices. The measurement format availabilities had been increased late in revision 4 of the firmware and further in both revision 5 and revision 6. Without full knowledge of the data frame sent by the device, the Version 1_Read Measurements VI will fail to properly parse the extra data.
